# I'm Danny (Yochran)

### About Me:
I'm a software & web developer who enjoys making software for minecraft and discord servers, as well as websites.

I know how to program in 11 languages, being Java, JS, TS, C, C++, HTML, CSS, C#, Python, VBScript and Kotlin. I rarely use Kotlin, Python or TypeScript, but the rest I use quite frequently.
